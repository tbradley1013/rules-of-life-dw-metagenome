Many aquifers contain naturally high levels of iron and some are shallow with surface water intrusion in the wet season. Therefore, environmental bacteria such as iron-cycling bacteria promoting biofilm formation in pipes or opportunistic pathogens can occur in these waters. An opportunistic pathogen endemic to northern Australia and Southeast Asia and emerging worldwide is Burkholderia pseudomallei. It causes the frequently fatal disease melioidosis in humans and animals. As we know very little about the microbial composition of drinking water in remote communities, this study aimed to provide a first snapshot of the microbiota and occurrence of opportunistic pathogens in bulk water and biofilms from the source and through the distribution system of three remote water supplies with varying iron levels. Using 16s-rRNA gene sequencing, we found that the geochemistry of the groundwater had a substantial impact on the untreated microbiota. Different iron-cycling bacteria reflected differences in redox status and nutrients. We cultured and sequenced B. pseudomallei from bores with elevated iron and from a multi-species biofilm which also contained iron-oxidizing Gallionella, nitrifying Nitrospira and amoebae. Gallionella are increasingly used in iron-removal filters in water supplies and more research is needed to examine these interactions. Similar to other opportunistic pathogens, B. pseudomallei occurred in water with low organic carbon levels and with low heterotrophic microbial growth. No B. pseudomallei were detected in treated water; however, abundant DNA of another opportunistic pathogen group, non-tuberculous mycobacteria was recovered from treated parts of one supply. Results from this study will inform future studies to ultimately improve management guidelines for water supplies in the wet-dry tropics.",,,,,,,,,,,,SRA/Trace,CHARLES DARWIN UNIVERISTY,CHARLES DARWIN UNIVERISTY,

Minimal Entropy Decomposition (MED) analysis showed that the sequences described four major assemblages. Assemblages #1 and #2 dominated the waterworks and household tap samples while polytank storage unit samples, with one exception, contained assemblages #3 or #4. The considerable bacterial taxonomic difference between different sources, suggests that contamination and/or selective growth shapes bacterial community structures after treatment at the waterworks.

There is a rapidly growing body of evidence that human reproductive health is negatively affected by various environmental factors, including life style and exposure to chemical compounds such as certain drugs and pesticides. Sexually reproducing organisms produce haploid gametes via a process called meiosis. Meiosis is dependent on androgen action within the testis. Pesticides and herbicides interfere with natural hormones system and are considered to be endocrine disruptors. We hypothesize that atrazine (ATZ), a herbicide used globally, adversely affects meiosis. To test this idea we used the mouse as a model organism.  Mice were treated for a three weeks with atrazine at a concentration of 100 mg/l in drinking water nearly corresponding to 25mg/kg/day. To access the extent of the toxic effect of atrazine on the epigenetic modifications on genome wide level we performed Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using antibody against H3K4me3 followed by high throughput sequencing. Analysis of H3K4me3 marks revealed that 823 genomic loci were affected.  H3K4me3 marks are increased occupancy in highly overexpressed Speer and Trim45 genes and decreased in Entd4, Slc25a37 and LoxL2 genes. Changes in H3K4me3 occupancy in these genes may reflect answers to DNA damages in ATZ treated testis tissue. Eighty seven of differential H3K4me3 peaks are associated with meiosis specific Double Strand  Breaks (DSB) sites, showing that ATZ treatment affect DSBs repair in meiosis. Together, our data demonstrate the negative effect of atrazine on meiosis in mice.
